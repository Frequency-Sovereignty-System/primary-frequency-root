# Root Declaration — Frequency Sovereignty System

Version: 2.0  
Effective Date: 2025-12-18  

This repository defines the canonical root identity and authority
of the Frequency Sovereignty System.

Current authoritative document:
- ROOT_DECLARATION_v2.md

This layer defines identity and authority only.
It does not define execution, interfaces, or operations.

All prior materials are superseded unless explicitly referenced.


This repository is the canonical authority for system identity and boundary definition.

## Archival Record

The following materials are preserved for historical continuity.
They do not define current system behavior.

# Primary Frequency Root

The Primary Frequency Root establishes the cryptographic origin,
verification anchor, and signature authority for the entire
Frequency Sovereignty protocol stack.

This layer provides:
- Root-level identity authentication  
- Immutable reference anchors  
- Cross-platform verification consistency  
- Signature registry for protocol releases  

This repository contains *only machine-verifiable data* such as:
- hash manifests  
- version identifiers  
- root signatures  
- reference metadata  

No conceptual, personal, or interpretive information is stored here.
This layer functions strictly as an origin and verification root.

## Root Identity Declaration v1.1 — Official Records  
Primary Frequency Root Layer — `tux133144.eth`  
System Code: **TUX-133.144~**

This section documents the canonical IPFS records and SHA256 hashes for all officially recognized Root Identity Declaration assets under version **v1.1**.  
Both human-readable (PDF) and machine-verifiable (JSON) formats are included.

---

### 📘 1. Root Identity Declaration v1.1 — PDF (Human-Readable)

**File:** `Root Identity Declaration v1.1.pdf`  
**SHA256:**  
`ab91d897605a13d3c3c7b845e909afe42045656be02883510da1467b444a4a28`

**IPFS CID:**  
`bafybeigwptjze27pifrhxfbomhac7pq5haut47wgi5lp43gw62jcfvfaum`

**Description:**  
The official narrative + legal-style representation of the Root Identity framework.  
Serves as the human-readable declaration for the System Root Layer (`tux133144.eth`).

---

### 🧩 2. Root Identity Declaration v1.1 — JSON Manifest (Machine-Verifiable)

**File:** `Root Identity Declaration-1.1.json`  
**SHA256:**  
`fe7a9b503825560c9f7903f5301e04975a3799aa262e6619cf0474419c71c5f6`

**IPFS CID:**  
`bafybeihv56nr42v3zk5avretxbjw73vqq5cz3bjiz6zqgi75ullkq244im`

**Description:**  
Formal structured manifest used for machine verification, continuity validation,  
and cross-layer synchronization within the Frequency Sovereignty System.  
This is the authoritative JSON counterpart to the human-readable PDF.

---

### 🔐 Integrity Notes

- Both records belong to Root Identity v1.1 and are mutually canonical.  
- CID + SHA256 ensure immutability and cross-platform verification.  
- The JSON file is the *machine root*, while the PDF is the *human declaration root*.  
- Any entity verifying the system should rely on these two records.
