This system is identifiable by its document structure,
version continuity, and provenance records.
Superficial replication without continuity
does not establish equivalence.


## Version Alignment Notice (Important)

This repository defines **authority and version precedence only**.

Root Declaration v2.0 does **not** replace or invalidate the substantive
protocol specifications defined in earlier versions.

Specifically:

- **PFIP Specification v1.1** remains the current and valid
  protocol-layer specification governing interface structure,
  validation rules, and technical constraints.
- Root Declaration v2.0 serves as the **authoritative index and
  interpretation anchor**, clarifying which documents are active,
  historical, or non-authoritative.

Earlier documents are **not invalidated by default**.
Their validity depends on explicit designation by the Root Declaration.

In this system:
- *Root v2.0 answers “which document is authoritative.”*
- *PFIP v1.1 answers “how the protocol works.”*

No execution logic, runtime behavior, or operational service
is defined at the Root Layer.



This repository is the canonical authority for system identity and boundary definition.

## Archival Record

The following materials are preserved for historical continuity.
They do not define current system behavior.

# Primary Frequency Root

The Primary Frequency Root establishes the cryptographic origin,
verification anchor, and signature authority for the entire
Frequency Sovereignty protocol stack.

This layer provides:
- Root-level identity authentication  
- Immutable reference anchors  
- Cross-platform verification consistency  
- Signature registry for protocol releases  

This repository contains *only machine-verifiable data* such as:
- hash manifests  
- version identifiers  
- root signatures  
- reference metadata  

No conceptual, personal, or interpretive information is stored here.
This layer functions strictly as an origin and verification root.

## Root Identity Declaration v1.1 — Official Records  
Primary Frequency Root Layer — `tux133144.eth`  
System Code: **TUX-133.144~**

This section documents the canonical IPFS records and SHA256 hashes for all officially recognized Root Identity Declaration assets under version **v1.1**.  
Both human-readable (PDF) and machine-verifiable (JSON) formats are included.

---

### 📘 1. Root Identity Declaration v1.1 — PDF (Human-Readable)

**File:** `Root Identity Declaration v1.1.pdf`  
**SHA256:**  
`ab91d897605a13d3c3c7b845e909afe42045656be02883510da1467b444a4a28`

**IPFS CID:**  
`bafybeigwptjze27pifrhxfbomhac7pq5haut47wgi5lp43gw62jcfvfaum`

**Description:**  
The official narrative + legal-style representation of the Root Identity framework.  
Serves as the human-readable declaration for the System Root Layer (`tux133144.eth`).

---

### 🧩 2. Root Identity Declaration v1.1 — JSON Manifest (Machine-Verifiable)

**File:** `Root Identity Declaration-1.1.json`  
**SHA256:**  
`fe7a9b503825560c9f7903f5301e04975a3799aa262e6619cf0474419c71c5f6`

**IPFS CID:**  
`bafybeihv56nr42v3zk5avretxbjw73vqq5cz3bjiz6zqgi75ullkq244im`

**Description:**  
Formal structured manifest used for machine verification, continuity validation,  
and cross-layer synchronization within the Frequency Sovereignty System.  
This is the authoritative JSON counterpart to the human-readable PDF.

---

### 🔐 Integrity Notes

- Both records belong to Root Identity v1.1 and are mutually canonical.  
- CID + SHA256 ensure immutability and cross-platform verification.  
- The JSON file is the *machine root*, while the PDF is the *human declaration root*.  
- Any entity verifying the system should rely on these two records.
