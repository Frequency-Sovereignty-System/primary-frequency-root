# Primary Frequency Root

The Primary Frequency Root establishes the cryptographic origin,
verification anchor, and signature authority for the entire
Frequency Sovereignty protocol stack.

This layer provides:
- Root-level identity authentication  
- Immutable reference anchors  
- Cross-platform verification consistency  
- Signature registry for protocol releases  

This repository contains *only machine-verifiable data* such as:
- hash manifests  
- version identifiers  
- root signatures  
- reference metadata  

No conceptual, personal, or interpretive information is stored here.
This layer functions strictly as an origin and verification root.
