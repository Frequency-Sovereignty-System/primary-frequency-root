# Non-Executable Safety and Use-Boundary Reference

for the Export and Deployment of Robotic Systems**

Reference Identity: TUX-133.144~

Reference Layer: Non-Executable Boundary Reference

Document Nature: Declarative, Non-Operational, Non-Binding

Publication Status: Public Reference Document

---

## 1. Purpose and Positioning

This document defines a non-executable, non-operational safety and use-boundary reference intended for the export, cross-border deployment, and integration of robotic systems.

It exists solely to clarify boundaries of use, responsibility separation, and risk interpretation in complex international environments involving robotics and artificial intelligence.

This reference does not constitute a control system, governance authority, operational protocol, or enforcement mechanism.

---

## 2. Scope of Applicability

This reference may be cited, referenced, or acknowledged by manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, research institutions, governmental or semi-governmental projects, insurers, auditors, or compliance reviewers.

It applies across robotic form factors, including humanoid, mobile, industrial, service, and AI-assisted robotic platforms, whether operating independently or as part of a larger system.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Executable Nature

This reference does not execute software, issue commands, influence runtime behavior, modify system logic, or participate in decision-making processes.

No robotic behavior, outcome, or action may be attributed to this reference layer.

All operational behavior remains entirely external to this document.

---

## 4. Separation of Responsibility

The existence, citation, or acknowledgment of this reference does not transfer, assume, or imply responsibility for design, deployment, operation, supervision, outcomes, or failures.

Operational responsibility remains exclusively with the deploying, operating, or controlling entities, subject to applicable law and contractual arrangements.

No reference layer, author, or source identifier assumes operational, supervisory, or behavioral liability.

---

## 5. Export and Jurisdictional Neutrality

This document does not grant export permission, certify regulatory compliance, or override national or regional laws.

Jurisdictional compliance remains the sole responsibility of the exporting and importing parties.

This reference asserts no jurisdiction and does not provide legal authorization of any kind.

---

## 6. Use Boundary Clarification

Unless explicitly authorized by applicable law and the responsible operating entity, robotic systems referencing this document are not intended for weaponization, autonomous law enforcement, coercive surveillance, biometric profiling without consent, or the replacement of legally mandated human judgment.

This document defines intent boundaries, not enforcement mechanisms.

---

## 7. Artificial Intelligence and Data Isolation

Robotic systems referencing this document are not to be interpreted as unrestricted data collection or training assets.

Interaction data, sensory data, behavioral logs, or user-generated content must not be reused for artificial intelligence training, persona modeling, behavioral replication, or secondary dataset construction unless explicitly authorized under applicable law and contractual agreement.

Cross-border data reuse requires independent compliance validation.

---

## 8. No Persona, Identity, or Psychological Attribution

Robotic behavior must not be interpreted as representing human personality, identity, intent, or psychological agency.

Functional output does not imply social, emotional, or cognitive equivalence to human actors.

---

## 9. Secondary Transfer and Reuse

If a robotic system is transferred, resold, repurposed, or integrated into another system, this reference does not automatically apply unless explicitly re-declared by the new responsible entity.

No implied continuity of applicability exists.

---

## 10. Non-Equivalence and Anti-Simulation Clause

Superficial modification, paraphrasing, restructuring, or stylistic alteration of this reference does not constitute functional equivalence.

Boundary intent is defined by substantive meaning rather than textual similarity.

---

## 11. Authorship, Source, and Liability Isolation

Authorship or origin attribution associated with this reference exists solely for provenance verification and authorship traceability.

Such attribution does not imply operational control, supervisory authority, execution responsibility, or behavioral influence over any robotic system.

No author, source identity, or reference origin may be held liable for downstream deployment, integration, or use.

---

## 12. Future Modification and Version Continuity

This reference may evolve, be revised, or superseded by future versions.

Such evolution does not retroactively modify, invalidate, or expand responsibility associated with prior versions.

Version continuity serves documentation and traceability purposes only.

---

## 13. Interpretation and Dispute Context

This document is not a contract, warranty, license, or legal advice.

In the event of dispute, it may serve as contextual evidence of declared intent and boundary clarification, without creating binding obligations.

---

## 14. Concluding Statement

This reference exists to reduce systemic ambiguity, support safer global deployment, preserve human accountability, and isolate non-operational risk.

It is intentionally non-executable, non-authoritative, and non-coercive.
